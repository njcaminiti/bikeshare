# bikeshare

This script presents the user with an interactive console for exploring data
collected from the bikeshare programs in three major U.S. cities over the first
half of 2017.

After choosing a city, the user will be provided options to explore data from 
that city's bikeshare program, including customer information, trip statistics,
usage volume by time of day, and detailed information on individual stations.
